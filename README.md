# Master-Code02-Simulation-of-Electrical-Power-Systems.
This repository has simulation codes for Electrical Power Systems of different sizes and compositions.
The data is shared from Electrical Systems in the United States through IEEE and simulated in MATLAB and MATPOWER.

Within this repository, there are 6 simulation cases of Electrical Systems in the United States, 
two cases of 4 buses (different lines and data), one case of 9, 14 and 30 buses respectively and a complete system study, proposed by IEEE.

This repository is complemented with the reports delivered (in Spanish) for the Master's in Engineering
subject "Analysis of Electrical Power Systems". Taught by PhD. Ismael Albino Padilla.
